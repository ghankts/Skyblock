# Skyblock
 
 Trying a new take on skyblock for minecraft 1.7.10. Sick of seeing the same old skyblock servers, so i've decided to take on this project. Code will stay public and I will notify if the project ends up dying. Might end up opening a server with this plugin once it's finished. Will update with a list of planned features soon.

currently depends on PermissionsEx to display player ranks in chat.
